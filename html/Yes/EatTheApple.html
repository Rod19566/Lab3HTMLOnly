            <h1>Eat the apple</h1>
            <p>
                She cautiously took a bite, and to her surprise, it tasted like nothing she had ever experienced before. It was as if the apple held a secret, a hint of adventure hidden beneath its crisp surface.
                From that day on, Petra's life took an unexpected turn. The apples seemed to hold a mysterious power, and as Petra continued to eat them, she discovered she had gained the ability to see glimpses of the future. 
                The once mundane walk to school became a journey filled with foresight, each step unraveling a new aspect of her newfound gift.
                Petra struggled to keep this ability a secret, but soon her close friends noticed her uncanny accuracy in predicting events. Some were fascinated, while others grew suspicious.
