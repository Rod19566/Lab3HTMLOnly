            <h1>Tell close friends</h1>
            <p>
              Petra decided to tell her closest friend Vivi first. Although Vivi was at first skeptical, she was fine with playing along, at least until proven fake. 
              Vivi asked Petra if she had any control over her ability in plan of testing its validity. "It happens at random, I haven't noticed a tell either." Unconvinced, Vivi
              called Alexa, another friend. The three meet at Alexa's house so they could have more privacy. Alexa has no doubt Petra tells the truth and asks why she hasn't made it public.
              Even if Petra said it all, no one would belive her because she had no way of proving her power.

              Petra has a vision. Excited, Petra exclaims, "I can prove it to you!!! Alexa, your mother will come back early to pick up Liam's guitar. He forgot it." Liam is Alexa's brother, he is taking guitar 
              guitar classes in the afternoon. 
              Vivi points to the living room, "Anyone could see he forgot his guitar, it's right there. This proves nothing." Alexa has so many questions but only asks, "When?".
              Petra answers, "3:38 pm. She'll make a sandwich, start to leave forgetting the guitar again, until Vivi tells her. She'll leave 3:52 pm." Vivi laughs, "Oh. And what if I don't say
              anything?" Petra with certainty tells them it will surely happen. What should Vivi do?
